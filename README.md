# TicTacToeGUI

I recently developed a Tic Tac Toe game with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java in NetBeans, and I couldn't be more thrilled about it! What started as a fun endeavor to play the game evolved into a deep dive into learning its strategies and coding them into the application.

Here's a quick overview of what the project entails:

ðŸ”¹ Tic Tac Toe Game: The game allows players to enjoy the classic Tic Tac Toe experience in a user-friendly interface. It's intuitive and engaging, making it perfect for players of all ages.

ðŸ”¹ Learning the Tricks: As I played the game, I began to notice certain winning patterns and strategies. I meticulously noted these down and integrated them into the game's logic.

ðŸ”¹ AI Opponent: To make the game even more challenging and enjoyable, I programmed the computer opponent to employ these winning strategies. Now, players can test their skills against a formidable AI opponent.

ðŸ”¹ Java GUI in NetBeans: Leveraging the power of Java and the convenience of NetBeans, I crafted a sleek and responsive GUI for the game. It's visually appealing and enhances the overall gaming experience.

# How to install:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the project in NetBeans IDE.
Build and run the project.
Start playing against the AI opponent or another player.
